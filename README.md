- Skilled in Python, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, AWS, Docker, ETL, Git, FastAPI and more!  
- Currently trying to expand my understanding of SQL and Systems Design!
- Obsessed with learning new things and in my free time can be found hiking with my dog, exercising, or playing video games(all while listening to a podcast)!
